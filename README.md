# Meteireann internal API wrapper
Meteireann doesn't provide public APIs for their data. Tat's why I've made this wrapper for their internal API for a weather station's data when I was building a weather station of my own.
>You can find station_ids at https://wow.met.ie/, clicking on a weather station > VIEW FULL OBSERVATION and copying **siteID**
